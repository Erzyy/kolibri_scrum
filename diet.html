            <h2>Hummingbird Diet Information</h2>
            <p class="diet-info">Hummingbirds primarily feed on nectar from flowers, which provides them with the energy they need for their high metabolism. Their long, specialized beaks and tongues allow them to reach deep into flowers to access the nectar.</p>
            <p class="diet-info">In addition to nectar, hummingbirds also consume small insects and spiders, which provide essential proteins and nutrients. They catch insects by hawking, a behavior where they snatch insects out of the air or from plants while hovering.</p>
            <p class="diet-info">To attract hummingbirds to your garden, you can plant a variety of flowers that produce nectar, such as trumpet vines, salvias, and penstemons. Providing sugar water in hummingbird feeders can also supplement their diet, especially during periods of low flower availability.</p>
            <p class="diet-info">It's important to avoid using pesticides in your garden, as they can harm hummingbirds and other beneficial insects. Creating a pesticide-free environment ensures a healthy habitat for these fascinating birds.</p>
